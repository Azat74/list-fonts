#List Fonts

A very basic PhotoShop script to list all fonts used in the currently open and active PSD. The script looks at all text layers, and will also find multiple fonts from the same text layer. The results are shown in a dialog box, the contents of which can be selected, copied and pasted. 

## Installation

Save the `List Fonts.jsx` file to your "Applications/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts" folder. Then open/reopen Photoshop.

## Usage

From the "File" menu, select "Scripts" and then "List Fonts". A dialog box will then appear listing the fonts used in the PSD.

## TODO

* Handle zero results a little nicer

## Disclaimer

I've only tested this on my Mac, running Adobe Photoshop CC 2014. It might not work for you.
