#List Fonts

A very basic PhotoShop script to list all fonts used in a PSD. The script looks at all text layers, and will also find multiple fonts from the same text layer. The results are shown in a dialog box, the contents of which can be selected, copied and pasted. 

## Installation

Save the `List Fonts.jsx` file to your "Applications/Adobe Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts" folder. Then open/reopen Photoshop.

## Usage

From the "File" menu, select "Scripts" and then "List Fonts". A dialog box will then appear listing the fonts used in the PSD.

## TODO

* Add warning if no documents are open
* Handle no results a little nicer
